;;  Rules
;;  ─────
;;  If selected window is:
;;    leftmost  (right only)  → its right border shows ┤, all others show │
;;    middle    (left+right)  → its left neighbor shows ├,
;;                              the selected window shows ┤,
;;                              all others show │
;;    rightmost (left only)   → its left neighbor shows ├,
;;                              all others show │
;;
;;  In terminal mode, the wrap glyph is also customized.
