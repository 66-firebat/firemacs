;;
;;  Accounts for the statuscolumn width (line numbers + ┃ separator) when
;;  calculating the terminal width, preventing content overflow.
;;
;;  The key variable is `window-adjust-process-window-size-function'.
;;  Eat calls this to get (WIDTH . HEIGHT) for the terminal.  The default
;;  uses `window-max-chars-per-line' which accounts for `display-line-numbers'
;;  but NOT for `line-prefix' (our ┃ separator).  We override it to subtract
;;  the prefix width (2 chars: space + ┃).

  ;; Eat's directory tracking updates `default-directory' when the shell
  ;; reports its working directory via OSC 7.  For this to work, your
  ;; .bashrc needs shell integration:
  ;;
  ;;   [ -n "$EAT_SHELL_INTEGRATION_DIR" ] && \
  ;;     source "$EAT_SHELL_INTEGRATION_DIR/bash"
  ;;
  ;; Once set up, `default-directory' in eat buffers tracks `cd' commands.
  ;; `my/dired-from-eat' (SPC d d) uses this to open dired in the eat
  ;; terminal's current directory.

  ;; Override terminal width calculation to account for the statuscolumn
  ;; `line-prefix' (2 chars).  This must be set buffer-locally in each eat
  ;; buffer via `eat-mode-hook'.  See `window-adjust-process-window-size-
  ;; function' in the Emacs Lisp manual for details.
